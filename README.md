**A privacy-first, offline-only expense tracker. Your data never leaves your browser.**

## Quick start

```bash
# Start the local dev server (http://localhost:8765)
npm run serve

# Kill the dev server when you're done
pkill -f "http.server 8765"

# Rebuild app.js after editing anything in src/
npm run build
```

Then open http://localhost:8765 in your browser. (Open it through the server, not by double-clicking `index.html` — encryption needs a secure context.)

## Features

- **Zero servers** — no backend, no database, no third-party calls.
- **Encrypted local autosave** — every change is automatically saved to your browser's storage, encrypted with AES-256-GCM. The key is generated on-device and never leaves the browser. Autosave can be paused from the header for an ephemeral, nothing-written session.
- **Encrypted export** — Export is the manual save: it produces a `.zip` containing your encrypted ledger plus the key to decrypt it. Import reads the zip (or the two files separately).
- **Receipt scanning** — client-side OCR (PP-OCRv5); photos and PDFs never leave your device.
- **Cross-platform** — adaptive OCR canvas profiles, responsive layout, desktop save-picker, and mobile camera/share fallbacks.

## How it works

OpenExpense is ES modules under `src/`, bundled into a single `app.js` that `index.html` loads. There's no build step on GitHub Pages — commit the rebuilt `app.js`.

```

└── ocr-platform.md    # OCR pipeline, platform profiles, and readable code tags
app.js                 # Bundled entry (rebuild with `npm run build`)
```

UI actions call `patch()` on the store; a subscriber re-renders and `persist.js` saves (encrypted, debounced) to IndexedDB.

## Receipt OCR platform notes

`src/config.js` exposes `OCR_CONFIG`, which centralizes OCR CDN pins, progress labels, parser aliases, confidence thresholds, and mobile/default/desktop canvas profiles. The receipt feature uses browser signals such as viewport, pointer type, hardware concurrency, device memory, and Save-Data to decide whether to warm the OCR engine in the background and how large to render images for recognition.

Readable tags such as `ocr.engine.load`, `ocr.profile.mobile`, `ocr.fix.decimal-bar`, and `merchant.amazon` live beside the rules they describe. See [`docs/ocr-platform.md`](docs/ocr-platform.md) before changing OCR dependencies, parser heuristics, or canvas sizing.

## Data format

Calendar dates map to expense records. This is the shape used in exports and inside the encrypted record.

```json
{
  "name": "GBA Expenses",
  "events": {
    "2026-06-03": [
      { "title": "API Hosting", "price": 49.99, "recurring": true }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Encryption & storage

- **Autosave = encrypted local storage.** Changes are debounced and written to the `openexpense` IndexedDB (v2), encrypted with AES-256-GCM. No files are involved — autosave never touches the disk as plaintext. It's on by default; the header disk button pauses it (changes then stay in memory only until re-enabled).
- The AES-GCM key is stored **non-extractable**, so its raw bytes can't be read back — even from devtools.
- Only non-sensitive UI prefs (theme, autosave on/off, first-visit) use `localStorage`. The ledger name and entries never do.
- **Export** is an encrypted `.zip` (via [`fflate`](https://github.com/101arrowz/fflate)) with `ledger.enc.json` (ciphertext) + `ledger.key.json` (the key) + `README.txt`. Anyone with both files can decrypt — for sensitive backups, store or send them separately.
- **Import** auto-detects: a full zip, a key and encrypted file loaded separately (in any order), or a legacy plaintext `.json`.
